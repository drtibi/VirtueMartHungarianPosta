# VirtueMartHungarianPosta
VirtueMart Plugin for Hungarian Post office API, pickup address list.

Authored by Drajk√≥ Tibor.

There was no free plugin till this for Hungarian Post Office API. It is a starter procejt for common 
use.

Maiking the plugin install: zip all files into one file and upload to Joomla.

How it is work. The Plugin open the Posta's API and load the Pickup Points into a table for VirtueMart 
shipments. The table autorefresh itself when its need. On frontside it is using a dropdrow fields, and 
replace Ship To Address field to the selected item. The goal was not supposed to general use, it created 
for a special project. I hope this save your time.

The language files not synchronized to English, only the Hungarian is the valid files.

If you make a better version share me to publish for the next user.
